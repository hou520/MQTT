* APLO-99 - Support a `browser-end:false` option on a `SUBSCRIBE` frame to allow a Queue browser to wait for new messages instead of closing the subscription
* APLO-100 - Support a `include-seq` and `from-seq` option on the `SUBSCRIBE` frame to finely control from where in a queue a subscription starts from.
