 * APLO-12 - Support finer grained security in the REST based admin API
 * APLO-21 - Support a protocol interceptor plugins to allow policy enforcement
 * APLO-22 - Support generic service plugins to on a broker so that admins can start/stop additional opaque services along /w the broker.
 * APLO-26 - Support directly addressing durable subscription queues
 * APLO-27 - Support finer grained selection of record and fields in the REST interface
 * APLO-29 - Add a new broker security roll to control access to viewing the broker configuration.

 * APLO-35- - Support installing as a background windows service
 * APLO-37- Update BDB store to use a single BTree for all queue entries and use variable encoding for the keys

Migration Notes:

It is recommended to you generate a new broker instance for this release.  The 1.0 beta3 release uses a slightly 
different default configuration (to create a https port for administration).  If your were using the BDB store,
this new release uses a totally different storage layout so you should export the data from the previous
versions, wipe the data directory and then import it into the broker on the new release.
