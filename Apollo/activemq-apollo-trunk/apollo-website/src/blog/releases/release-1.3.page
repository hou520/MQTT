The [Apache ActiveMQ Project](http://activemq.apache.org) is pleased to announce the 
availability of Apollo 1.3. ActiveMQ Apollo is a faster, more reliable, easier

This release fixes several bugs, improves performance and introduces a few
new features:

* [APLO-160] - Reduce memory overhead of many connections.
* [APLO-188] - Add "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" and "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" to CORS requests
* [APLO-192] - "java.lang.AssertionError: Dispatch queue 'virtual-host' was not executing" occurs when queue or dsub is deleted via web admin
* [APLO-198] - Apollo sometimes does not send all the messages in a queue
* [APLO-193] - Support filtering outgoing messages
* [APLO-196] - Allow protocol filters to drop a messages
