The [Apache ActiveMQ Project](http://activemq.apache.org) is pleased to announce the 
availability of Apollo 1.5. ActiveMQ Apollo is a faster, more reliable, easier 
to maintain messaging broker built from the foundations of the original ActiveMQ. 

This release fixes several bugs especially around Openwire and WebSockets and introduces a few
improvements like:

* [APLO-30] - Support the Openwire Protocol
* [APLO-177] - Add a UDP based protocol support to Apollo
* [APLO-232] - Add support for enforcing a message count based quota on queues
* [APLO-239] - Aggregate connection-level messages (and bytes) metrics at connector and broker level
* [APLO-242] - Support STOMP frames over UDP
* [APLO-260] - Contribute the FuseSource MQTT impl to Apache and included as part of the default Apollo distribution.
* [APLO-261] - Support the 1.2 STOMP spec.
* [APLO-163] - Auto tune the per-connection buffers (receive_buffer_size and send_buffer_size)
* [APLO-179] - Remove the list of connections from the toplevel REST URI
* [APLO-200] - Support configuring protocol filters
* [APLO-243] - Do not lower the maximum number of open files
* [APLO-250] - add_user_header should prevent forging
* [APLO-251] - Share a single queue for all consumers on topic configured with slow_consumer_policy="queue"
* [APLO-259] - Support Telnet clients that send '\r\n' character to terminate a line
* [APLO-262] - Documented OpenWire features
* [APLO-263] - Remove slf4j from openwire examples
