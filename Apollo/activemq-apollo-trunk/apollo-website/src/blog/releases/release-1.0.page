The [Apache ActiveMQ Project](http://activemq.apache.org) is pleased to announce the 
availability of Apollo 1.0. ActiveMQ Apollo is a faster, more reliable, easier 
to maintain messaging broker built from the foundations of the original ActiveMQ. 
Apollo is the fastest and most robust STOMP server.

Noteworthy changes since the last beta include:

* [APLO-120] - Add a --with-ssl option to the apollo create command to control if an SSL enabled configuration is created.
* [APLO-134] - LevelDB store should use a file lock so a broker instance get exclusive access to the store data.
* [APLO-135] - Add example to the distro that shows how you can boot up an embedded broker in a Java app.
* [APLO-109] - Apollo should run with assertions enabled by default unless APOLLO_ASSERTIONS=false is set in the env.
* [APLO-110] - Provide more information in case of authentication failure
* [APLO-112] - Support for TLS 1.2
* [APLO-118] - All configuration attributes which configure memory/disk usage sizes should support values like "1k" "2G" etc.
* [APLO-124] - call the LoginModule.logout method
* [APLO-125] - Client authentication error message
* [APLO-128] - Simplify the leveldb-store's log record format so that every record has a checksum which can be used to quickly validate all read data in case your paranoid about data corruption in your FS
* [APLO-130] - Allow acquired queue entries to get swapped.  This is especially handy if the entry was already persisted anyways.
* [APLO-131] - Stores should track "storage schema version number" to detect when the store is incompatible with a new broker version.
* [APLO-136] - Support dots in a dsub name
* [APLO-141] - The connection screen displays 'transport: tcp' even though the connection came in over the tls port.
* [APLO-139] - Simplify the JSON encoding of the @class field
