    * [#{project_svn_url}](#{project_svn_url})

    If you are new to SVN you might have a look at the

    You must first install a [SVN client](http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html). Then 
    you check out the project using the following:

        cd #{project_id}

    Now you probably want to try [build the #{project_name} code](building.html)
